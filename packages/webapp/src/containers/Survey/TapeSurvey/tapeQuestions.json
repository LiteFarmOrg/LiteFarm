The data collected through TAPE helps to evaluate\n    the contribution of agroecology to this transformation. TAPE helps build knowledge and empower producers,\n    supports agroecological transition, and informs policy makers and development institutions by creating\n    references on the multidimensional performance of agroecology and its potential contribution to the\n    Sustainable Development Goals.\n  </p>\n\n  <h4>Agreement</h4>\n  <p>\n    By using the TAPE tool, you acknowledge and agree that these Terms of Use and the FAO Data Protection and\n    Privacy Notice (as may be amended by FAO from time to time and without notice) shall apply.
