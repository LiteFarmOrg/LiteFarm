# Code Guide

### Here is a guide for refactoring legacy code or adding new components to the codebase.


**Pure Components vs Smart Components**

Pure components live in the `components` folder and contain only the code that renders the view of the component. Smart components live in the `containers` folder and contain the smart logic - button click, animation, retrieving data from the redux store or backend, etc - for the component. Here is an example from `HarvestLog`.

In `src/containers/Log/HarvestLog`, the container contains the logic for what happens when the user clicks the back or next button, including dispatching actions to the redux store and saving data.

The container also renders the `PureHarvestLog` component (note that naming of pure components are preceded by "Pure"), and passes relevant props to handle the next and back button logic, as well as other data.

In `src/components/Logs/HarvestLog`, the component contains very simple logic, such as validating that an input field contains a number up to 2 decimal places, and the logic for when a user clicks the next button, with a call to `onNext` (which is a prop passed by the container).

The component also contains the styles - in this case, the styles for the form - as well as the imports for other components (eg - `TitleLayout`).

**Redux Slices**

We use `redux slice` to create the initial state of the redux store for that component, as well as its corresponding actions, reducers, and selectors. Check out `containers/Log/Utility/logSlice` for an example.

**Storybook**

Every new view that is created should have a corresponding story in `Storybook`. To do that, create a new folder and corresponding file that endas in ".stories.js" in the `stories` folder, and import the pure component in that file.
