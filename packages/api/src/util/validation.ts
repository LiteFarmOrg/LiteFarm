 * Matches:
 * - 2025-05-15T14:30:59Z
 * - 2025-05-15T14:30:59.123Z
 * - 2025-05-15T14:30:59+02:00
 * - 2025-05-15T14:30:59.123-05:00
 *
 * Does NOT match:
 * - 2025-05-15 (date only)
 * - 2025-05-15T14:30 (missing seconds)
 * - Missing timezone (e.g., 2025-05-15T14:30:59)
 *
 * Not susceptible to RE-dos:
 * - No nested quantifiers
 * - All quantifiers (\d{n} and \d+) are bounded or isolated
 * - The regex is anchored at the start and end (^ and $)
 *
 * Potential Issues:
 * - 2025-99-99T99:99:99Z would match, even though it's invalid.
 * - Just matching Z or +00:00 doesnâ€™t ensure your app interprets the timezone correctly unless you parse and normalize it.
 * - Millisecond flooding (extremely rare): The \d+ for milliseconds could theoretically match a very long string like .12345678901234567890... (most regex engines will cut off long matches anyway).
