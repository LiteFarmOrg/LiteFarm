##### Version 3.0:

#### Informed Consent Form and Privacy Policy (Farm Owner and Farm Manager Version)

Welcome to LiteFarm! We understand that your privacy and the protection of your data are important to you. We created this Informed Consent Form and Privacy Policy to help you understand how and when we collect, use and share your information, and to ensure we have your consent for doing so. Please keep in mind that you will need to consent separately to our collection and use of your data as described in this Informed Consent Form and Privacy Policy **for every farm that you are associated with via your account on the LiteFarm platform**. If you do not agree with our practices as outlined in this Informed Consent Form and Privacy Policy, you will not be able to use the LiteFarm platform.

#### What is Litefarm ?

LiteFarm is a participatory science project developed to help improve access to digital agricultural technology for farming communities. LiteFarm aims to help farmers manage their farms in more profitable and environmentally and socially sustainable ways. The code underlying LiteFarm is free and open source (GPLv3) so that researchers, experts, and developers across the world can help to improve the services offered to the farming community. LiteFarm is a non-commercial entity. We are driven to serve the farming community through improving agricultural decision-support and research.

#### Who is the Litefarm team? 

The LiteFarm team is a cross-disciplinary group of scientists, researchers, farmers, designers and software professionals. The team was initially formed at the University of British Columbia (UBC), and has grown to include a participatory network of individuals and organizations.The Principle Investigators are Dr. Zia Mehrabi and Dr. Hannah Wittman (hannah.wittman@ubc.ca).

#### Who funds Litefarm? 

LiteFarm is funded by the Centre for Sustainable Food Systems at UBC and other grants. For a complete list, please visit: [https://ubcfarm.ubc.ca/litefarm/](https://ubcfarm.ubc.ca/litefarm/). Our funders have no say in the operation and management of LiteFarm, and are unable to access any of the personal information housed on the platform. Our funding model is currently donor and grant-driven.

#### Why are we conducting this project ?

We recognize gaps in farmer access to digital technology services, low adoption rates, and a need expressed by farmers to combine a range of advisory services in a single, free to use, non-commercially driven platform. We want to develop a solution that both helps farmers operate their business in a more financially and ecologically sustainable way, and also helps advance the science of sustainability.

#### What data do we collect? 

Depending on which parts of the LiteFarm platform you use, we may collect different kinds of information:

**Personal Information**

"Personal Information" describes any information that can be used to identify you or your workers. LiteFarm will never disclose personal information to third parties. This includes:
* Contact information (name, address, phone number, email address)

*  Business information (farm name, farm address)

*  Photos

*  Internet Protocol (IP) address

*  Worker information (name, role on farm, email address)

*  Geolocation (e.g., GPS coordinates of fields, field boundaries, etc.)


**Farm Management Information:**

LiteFarm uses the management information that you enter into the app to generate insights about the financial, environmental, and social benefits or impacts of your management decisions. We anonymize this data to conduct non-commercial academic research on sustainable food systems. Because this data is anonymized when used in our research, it cannot be traced to you or your farm. This data includes:

* Activity log information: activity times and dates; photos; notes

* Pest control log information: product name; amount of product applied; application target (i.e., pest or disease name), common name, scientific name, group; active ingredient name; active ingredient concentration; harvest interval; entry interval; type of control (systemic spray, foliar spray, fumigation, burning, biological control, hand pick, or heat treatment); field and crop applied to

* Harvest log information: field harvested; crop harvested; quantity harvested

* Seeding log information: field seeded; crop seeded; spacing depth, length, width, and rate

* Field work log information: field; type of work (plow, ridge till, zone till, mulch till, rip)

* Soil analysis log information: field; depth; texture; percentage potassium, phosphorus, nitrogen, organic matter, organic carbon, inorganic carbon, total carbon, sulfur, calcium, magnesium, sodium, zinc, manganese, iron, copper, boron; cation exchange capacity (CEC); pH; bulk density

* Irrigation log information: field; irrigation type (drip, sprinkler, subsurface, flood); flow rate; total time flowing

* Scouting log information: field; crop; type (harvest, pest, disease, weed, other); action needed (yes/no)

* Other log information: field; crops

* Shift information: date; shift length; start and end times; break duration; shift activity (bed preparation, delivery, sales, seeding, harvesting, fertilizing, sales, scouting, pest control, wash and pack, weeding, other, custom task); time allocation to each activity (per field or per crop); mood (happy, very happy, sad, very sad, neutral)

*  Seeding log information: field seeded; crop seeded; spacing depth, length, width, and rate

**Usage Data**

We collect usage data (i.e., general statistics about users, traffic patterns, and how users respond to various site features) to improve the quality of services we provide to you. This type of data includes: when you log in to LiteFarm, pages you request, how long you visit the site for, how you interact with the app, and technical details about your device (e.g., browser, screen type, and processor). This data will either be associated with your LiteFarm username (if you are logged into the app) or your IP address (if you are not logged in). We may use software such as Google Analytics to collect this data, but in these cases, all personal information will be anonymized.

**How do we use data?**

As described above, we use your usage data (i.e., general information about how you interact with the LiteFarm platform) to improve the LiteFarm platform and the services it provides.

**What do we share?** 

We will only share your data with third parties if it is both anonymized (i.e., contains no personal information) and necessary to accomplish our research goals or validate scientific findings. Specifically, we may share anonymized data at some point in the future with other researchers for non-commercial academic research purposes. Any third-party academic researchers who request use of LiteFarm data will undergo internal review, and will be assessed under our existing ethics and security standards. Due to publishing standards for scientific reproducibility, anonymized data that is used for academic research may be served on public repositories. Copies of non-public releases of anonymized data can be shared with academic researchers for non-commercial research purposes, under time-limited and confidential single-use licenses. If an academic research use includes the use of photos uploaded to LiteFarm, any identifiable features that disclose personal information (e.g., faces of people) will be blurred out of the photos before they are shared. We do not share any personal information to third party analytics services, such as Google Analytics. Through our security protocols, we safeguard the vulnerability of personal information within the LiteFarm website, and we use IP anonymization protocols to prevent identification and geolocation by third parties. LiteFarm will not rent or sell your personal information or any data collected through LiteFarm website to anyone.
