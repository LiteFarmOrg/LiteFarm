#### Informed Consent Form and Privacy Policy (Farm Owner and Farm Manager Version)

&nbsp;

Welcome to LiteFarm! We understand that your privacy and the protection of your data are important to you. We created this Informed Consent Form and Privacy Policy to help you understand how and when we collect, use and share your information, and to ensure we have your consent for doing so. Please keep in mind that you will need to consent to our collection and use of your data as described in this Informed Consent Form and Privacy Policy for every farm that you are associated with via your account on the LiteFarm platform. If you do not agree with our practices as outlined in this Informed Consent Form and Privacy Policy, you will not be able to use the LiteFarm platform.

&nbsp;

#### What is Litefarm?

&nbsp;

LiteFarm is a participatory science project developed to help improve access to digital agricultural technology for farming communities. LiteFarm aims to help farmers manage their farms in more profitable and environmentally and socially sustainable ways. The code underlying LiteFarm is free and open source (GPLv3) so that researchers, experts, and developers across the world can help to improve the services offered to the farming community. LiteFarm is a non-commercial entity. We aim to serve the farming community through improving agricultural decision-support and research.

&nbsp;

#### Who is the Litefarm team?

&nbsp;

The LiteFarm team is a cross-disciplinary group of scientists, researchers, farmers, designers and software professionals. The team was initially formed at the University of British Columbia (UBC), and has grown to include a participatory global network of individuals and organizations. The Principal Investigators are Dr. Zia Mehrabi (University of Colorado) and Dr. Hannah Wittman (hannah.wittman@ubc.ca).

&nbsp;

#### Who funds Litefarm?

&nbsp;

LiteFarm is funded by the Centre for Sustainable Food Systems at UBC and other grants. For a complete list, please visit: https://www.litefarm.org/partners. Our funders have no say in the operation and management of LiteFarm, and are unable to access any of the personal information housed on the platform. Our funding model is currently donor and grant-driven.

&nbsp;

#### Why are we conducting this project ?

&nbsp;

We recognize gaps in farmer access to digital technology services, low adoption rates, and a need expressed by farmers to combine a range of advisory services in a single, non-commercially driven platform. We want to develop a solution that both helps farmers operate their business in a more financially and ecologically sustainable way, and also helps advance the science of sustainability.

&nbsp;

#### What data do we collect?

&nbsp;

Depending on which parts of the LiteFarm platform you use, we may collect different kinds of information:  
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Personal Information**
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

"Personal Information" describes any information that can be used to identify you or your workers. LiteFarm will never disclose personal information to third parties without your express consent. This includes:

- Contact information (name, address, phone number, email address)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Farm Management Information:**
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

LiteFarm uses the management information that you enter into the app to generate insights about the financial, environmental, and social benefits or impacts of your management decisions. We anonymize this data to conduct non-commercial academic research on sustainable food systems. Because this data is anonymized when used in our research, it cannot be traced to you or your farm. This data includes:

- Farm location information: different types of locations on the farm, including size; names; crops planted in locations; tasks assigned to locations; organic status; and other attributes specific to location type.

- Crop information: crop type, varietal, supplier, common names, species, genus, crop group, seed treatment status, organic certification status and supporting information.

- Expense information: date; type; name; expense amount.

- Sales information: date; name of buyer/market; crop; amount sold (kg); revenue.

&nbsp;

**Usage Data**
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

We collect usage data (i.e., general statistics about users, traffic patterns, and how users respond to various site features) to improve the quality of services we provide to you. This type of data includes: when you log in to LiteFarm, pages you request, how long you visit the site for, how you interact with the app, and technical details about your device (e.g., browser, screen type, and processor). This data will either be associated with your LiteFarm username (if you are logged into the app) or your IP address (if you are not logged in). We may use software such as Google Analytics to collect this data, but in these cases, all personal information will be anonymized.  
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**How do we use data?**
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

There are three primary ways that we use your data:

- To improve the services we provide you with: As described above, we use your usage data (i.e., general information about how you interact with the LiteFarm platform) to improve the LiteFarm platform and the services it provides.

- To generate insights about the financial, environmental, and social benefits or impacts of your management decisions: The LiteFarm platform uses the management data that you enter into the app (see “Farm management information” section above for a full list), along with built-in algorithms and some public data (e.g., local weather station information, crop coefficients, crop and fertilizer nutrient content, species occurrence data, and topographic data) to generate insights about financial, environmental, and social benefits/impacts of your management decisions.

- To conduct non-commercial academic research on sustainable food systems: Along with our academic collaborators, we will use your anonymized farm management data (see “Farm management information” section above for a full list) to conduct agronomic, ecological, and food-systems based academic research. Some of this research will be conducted by PhD students as part of their graduate degrees. We will rigorously evaluate every project proposal to ensure that your data is used effectively to advance knowledge on sustainable food systems, help farmers make sustainable management decisions, and impact public policy to benefit farmers. We will keep you in the loop on research projects through email (unless you would prefer to opt out), and you can always reach out to us to learn more about the research that your data is helping to make possible. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

**What do we share?**
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

We will only share your data with third parties if it is both anonymized (i.e., contains no personal information) and necessary to accomplish our research goals or validate scientific findings. Specifically, we may share anonymized data at some point in the future with other researchers for non-commercial academic research purposes. Any third-party academic researchers who request use of LiteFarm data will undergo internal review, and will be assessed under our existing ethics and security standards. Due to publishing standards for scientific reproducibility, anonymized data that is used for academic research may be served on public repositories. Copies of non-public releases of anonymized data can be shared with academic researchers for non-commercial research purposes, under time-limited and confidential single-use licenses. If an academic research use includes the use of photos uploaded to LiteFarm, any identifiable features that disclose personal information (e.g., faces of people) will be blurred out of the photos before they are shared. We do not share any personal information to third party analytics services, such as Google Analytics. Through our security protocols, we safeguard the vulnerability of personal information within the LiteFarm website, and we use IP anonymization protocols to prevent identification and geolocation by third parties. LiteFarm will not rent or sell your personal information or any data collected through LiteFarm website to anyone without your express consent.
