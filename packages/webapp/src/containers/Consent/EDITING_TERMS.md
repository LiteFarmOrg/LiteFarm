## Editing Terms and conditions files

Changing the consent files should be as easy as changing or adding text to the
`Owner.consent.md` or `Worker.Consent.md` files. 

These files were written in Markdown, Markdown is a _lightweight markup language, with plain text formatting syntax_,
we use Markdown because, being plain text allows us to keep track of whatever changes happen to these files 
(which file types like `docx` won't allow us) without sacrificing styling.

If you need more information about how to write all kinds of things in markdown, head down to the
[markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
