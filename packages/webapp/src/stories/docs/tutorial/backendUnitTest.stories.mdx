### 1. Copy paste an existing test file as template under `packages/api/tests` directory
**Here is a list of tests that can be used as templates**

- managementPlan.test.js

- crop.test.js

- shift.test.js

- disease.test.js

- expense.test.js

- expense_type.test.js

- fertilizer.test.js

- pesticides.test.js

- price.test.js

- sale.test.js

**You can follow `location.test.js` or `mock.factories.test.js` if you think api will be stable**

These tests are more abstracted. They are difficult to read/debug/modify. You should use previous templates if tests need to cover edge cases.

**A list of test that will be deprecated**

- authorization.test.js

- insightAPI.test.js

- yield.test.js

- price.test.js

- logs.test.js

- shift.test.js

### 2. Set up database before each test cases

** 1. Create new mock factory in file `mock.factories.js` **

- First copy paste a pair of `fakeEntity()` and `entityFactory()` functions as template

```js
async function fieldFactory({
  promisedStation = weather_stationFactory(),
  promisedFarm = farmFactory(),
  promisedLocation = locationFactory({ promisedFarm }),
  promisedArea = areaFactory({ promisedLocation }, fakeArea(), 'field'),
} = {}, field = fakeField()) {
  const [station, location] = await Promise.all([promisedStation, promisedLocation, promisedArea]);
  const [{ station_id }] = station;
  const [{ location_id }] = location;
  return knex('field').insert({ location_id: location_id, station_id, ...field }).returning('*');
}

function fakeField() {
  return {
    organic_status: faker.random.arrayElement(['Non-Organic', 'Transitional', 'Organic']),
    transition_date: faker.date.future(),
  };
}

module.exports = {
  fieldFactory, fakeField
}
```

- Then use the template to complete `fakeEntity()` and `entityFactory()` for your new objection model.
- You can also use IDE search function to find necessary [faker](https://github.com/Marak/Faker.js) / [knex](http://knexjs.org/) methods
- Run `mock.factories.test.js` to make sure everything passes

**2. Update clean up script `/api/tests/testEnvironment`**

If tests involve new tables, we need to update clean up script so that all rows in database will be deleted after one test file finishes.
- If we just added location table, which depends on farm, we need to delete location before userFarm/users/farm, otherwise clean up script will return foreign key violation error
```js
async function tableCleanup(knex) {
  return knex.raw(`
    DELETE FROM "location"; // new table
    DELETE FROM "userFarm";
    DELETE FROM "farm";
    DELETE FROM "users";
  `);
}
```

**3. Set up database before each test**

There are two ways to set up

- Create set up functions and use them in each test (example: `location.test.js` or `shift.test.js`).

```js
  function appendFieldToFarm(farm_id, n = 1) {
    return Promise.all(
      [...Array(n)].map(() => mocks.fieldFactory({
        promisedLocation: mocks.locationFactory({ promisedFarm: [{ farm_id }] })
      }))
    );
  }
  describe('GET /location by farm', () => {
        test('should GET 2 fields linked to that farm', async (done) => {
        await appendFieldToFarm(farm, 2);
        getLocationsInFarm({user_id: user, farm_id: farm}, farm, (err, res) => {
          expect(res.status).toBe(200);
          done();
      });
    });
  })
```

- [Set up in beforeEach set up block](https://jestjs.io/docs/setup-teardown)

```js
  describe('Crop Tests', () => {
  let newOwner;
  let farm;
  beforeEach(async () => {
      [newOwner] = await mocks.usersFactory();
      [farm] = await mocks.farmFactory();
      const [ownerFarm] = await mocks.userFarmFactory({
        promisedUser: [newOwner],
        promisedFarm: [farm],
      }, fakeUserFarm(1));
    })
  });
```

<Card color={'secondary'} style={{ padding: '16px' }}>
  <Text>To test patch field endpoint, we need to set up all field dependencies such as
    user/userFarm/location/area/figure tables.</Text>
  <br />
  <Text>We also need to set up farm owner/manager/extension officer/worker for authorization tests</Text>
  <br />
  <Text>In the test scope, we need to have access to user_id, farm_id, and location_id to make the request and check
    result</Text>
</Card>

### 3. Test driver functions

Here are four example driver functions:

```js
  function postRequest(data, { user_id = newOwner.user_id, farm_id = farm.farm_id }, callback) {
    chai.request(server).post('/crop')
      .set('Content-Type', 'application/json')
      .set('user_id', user_id) //set req header
      .set('farm_id', farm_id) //set req header
      .send(data) //set req.body
      .end(callback)
  }
  // mock implementation of ./src/middleware/acl/checkJwt will further put header.user_id in req.user.user_id
  // to mock jwt authentication result

  function getRequest(url, { user_id = newOwner.user_id, farm_id = farm.farm_id }, callback) {
    chai.request(server).get(url)
      .set('user_id', user_id)
      .set('farm_id', farm_id)
      .end(callback)
  }

  function putCropRequest(data, { user_id = newOwner.user_id, farm_id = farm.farm_id }, callback) {
    const { crop_id } = data;
    chai.request(server).put(`/crop/${crop_id}`)
      .set('farm_id', farm_id)
      .set('user_id', user_id)
      .send(data)
      .end(callback)
  }

  function deleteRequest(url, { user_id = newOwner.user_id, farm_id = farm.farm_id }, callback) {
    chai.request(server).delete(url)
      .set('user_id', user_id)
      .set('farm_id', farm_id)
      .end(callback)
  }
```

### 4. Writing tests
```js
      test('Workers should get crop by farm id', async (done) => {
        //Driver function for get crop request
        getRequest(`/crop/farm/${farm.farm_id}`, { user_id: worker.user_id }, (err, res) => {
          expect(res.status).toBe(200);
          done();
        });
      })
```

[Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect)

There are four cases we need to test

- Success with 200/201
- req.body validation fails
<Card color={'secondary'} style={{ padding: '16px' }}>
  <Text>When user posts a field, req.body.location.figure.type === "area". If type is any other string such as "line" or
    "point", endpoint should return 400</Text>
</Card>
- Authorization tests
<Card color={'secondary'} style={{ padding: '16px' }}>
  <Text>For this test, we need to make sure new user permissions are inserted into permission and rolePermission
    tables</Text>
  <br />
  <Text>If we want to test post field endpoint, we need to make sure <strong>owner/manager/extension officer of current
    farm</strong> can post successfully but <strong>owner/manager/extension officer of another farm and worker of
    current farm</strong> can't post field </Text>
  <br />
  <Text>Requests should fail with 403</Text>
</Card>
- Patch protected column fails
<Card color={'secondary'} style={{ padding: '16px' }}>
  <Text>If we allow a farm owner to patch user info of a worker but farm owner should not be able to patch worker's
    email address to gain access to the account. In this case, we need to write tests trying to patch email from
    different perspective and make sure all attempts fail</Text>
  <br />
  <Text>Objection provide <a
    href={'https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/api/query-builder/mutate-methods.html#upsertgraph'}>upsertGraph</a> method,
    which allows us to update multiple tables with single query. However, if the query is not written properly, one can
    update user table through user_id by sending following request. If upsertGraph is used, we need to write test to
    make sure the endpoint can't modify unintended tables</Text>
</Card>

```js
const maliciousPatchUserFarmRequestBody = {
  user_id: 'user_id',
  farm_id: 'farm_id',
  user:{
      user_id: 'user_id',
      email: 'new email'
  },
  farm:{
      farm_id: 'farm_id'
  }
}
```

### 5. Run tests to make sure tests fail as expected

### 6. Middleware mock implementation

After controllers are implemented, if test always fails, we might need to add mock implementations to functions that cause tests to fail

Most endpoints are guarded by `checkJwt()` (jwt authentication middleware) . Authorization middleware `checkScope()` will then use the result (res.user) returned by jwt authentication middleware to check user permissions.
In this case, we need to mock `checkJwt()` (jwt authentication middleware) so that `checkJwt()` will never return 401 and driver function can pass user_id into req.user for authorization.
```js
jest.mock('jsdom')
jest.mock('../src/middleware/acl/checkJwt')
const mocks = require('./mock.factories');
describe('Crop Tests', () => {
    beforeEach(async () => {
      middleware = require('../src/middleware/acl/checkJwt');
      middleware.mockImplementation((req, res, next) => {
        req.user = {};
        req.user.user_id = req.get('user_id');
        next()
      });
  })
})
```
